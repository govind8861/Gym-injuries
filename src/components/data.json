        "Treatment will depend on your symptoms and the length of time you have them. Your caregiver may want you to limit activity on your affected shoulder to decrease stress on the tendon. This may help prevent further damage, decrease pain, and promote tendon healing.\n\nThe primary treatment is resting the shoulder and, for minor tears and inflammation, applying ice packs. You may need to wear a sling to keep the shoulder from moving.\n\nAnti-inflammatory medications may also be prescribed. As soon as pain decreases, physical therapy is usually started to help regain normal motion. If pain persists after several weeks, the physician may inject cortisone into the affected area.\n\nSurgery: If you have a large tear in your rotator cuff, you may need surgery to repair the tear. Sometimes during this kind of surgery, doctors may remove a bone spur or calcium deposits.\n\nThe surgery may be performed as an open repair through a 6- to 10-centimeter incision, or as an arthroscopic repair with the aid of a small camera inserted through a smaller incision. An arthroscope is used to view the shoulder joint and confirm the presence of a tear. It can also remove any bone spurs that may be present in the shoulder area.\n\nThe arthroscopic procedures usually involve a 2-inch incision in the outer shoulder. During this time, the torn rotator edge may be reattached to the humerus with stitches.\n\nArthroplasty: Some long-standing shoulder muscle tears may contribute to the development of rotator cuff arthropathy, which can include severe arthritis. In such cases, your doctor may discuss with you more extensive surgical options, including partial shoulder replacement (hemiarthroplasty) or total shoulder replacement (prosthetic arthroplasty).\n\nA unique treatment option now available involves the use of a reverse ball-and-socket prosthesis. This reverse shoulder prosthesis is most appropriate for people who have very difficult shoulder problems. These include having arthritis in the joint, along with extensive tears of multiple muscles and tendons (rotator cuff) that support the shoulder, or having extensive rotator cuff tears and a failed previous shoulder joint replacement."

        "Why do rotator cuff injuries happen?\n\nRotator Cuff Tear: A ripping of one or more of the tendons. Result when a sudden eccentric force is applied to the rotator cuff resulting in the failure of the tendon. Uncommon under the age of 40 but strains do occur. In the population over 40 years of age, supraspinatus tears occur and less commonly, infraspinatus tears. Tears in the subscapularis tendon are uncommon and are often the result of a shoulder dislocation.\n\nCauses\n\nPoor posture: When you slouch your neck and shoulders forward, the space where the rotator cuff muscles reside can become smaller. This can allow a muscle or tendon to become pinched under your shoulder bones, including your collarbone, especially during overhead activities, such as throwing.\n\nFalling: Using your arm to break a fall or falling on your arm can bruise or tear a rotator cuff tendon or muscle.\n\nLifting or Pulling: Lifting an object that's too heavy, or doing so improperly (especially overhead), can strain or tear your tendons or muscles.\n\nPulling something, such as an archery bow of too heavy poundage, may cause an injury."

Improper form can place unnecessary stress on your lower back.\n- Gradually increase weights and intensity to allow your muscles and connective tissues to adapt.\n- Incorporate core-strengthening exercises to provide stability and support to your spine.\n- Listen to your body and don't push through pain. If an exercise causes discomfort or pain, stop immediately.\n\nIf you've already experienced a lower back injury, it's essential to prioritize your recovery:\n- Rest and allow your body to heal. Avoid exercises that worsen the pain.\n- Consult a healthcare professional or physical therapist for guidance on rehabilitation exercises.\n- Focus on gentle stretches to maintain flexibility and prevent muscle tightness.\n- Consider low-impact exercises, like swimming or stationary cycling, to maintain fitness without aggravating the injury.\n- Gradually reintroduce gym exercises under the guidance of a fitness professional or physical therapist."
